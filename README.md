# Welcome :D
  > Hello! This page is created for my own pleasure and to keep track of my progress. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science major at the University of Georgia. I recently transfered to this university just the previous semester ago in Spring '24. Upon taking my first software development course here in Fall '24, ~~(after not being able to take any cs classes due to regrestion be full by the time I transferred T_T)~~ I've realized that my peers here are much more experienced and ahead compared to my skills. They've inspired me to start learning lanuages and begin creating projects on my own to further my skills. 

  > Additionally, this is great practice for using Git, Github, and VS Code 
  


  ## My Journey into the World of Web Development!
  This site is a personal documentation of my self-taught adventure with HTML and CSS. I will be documenting my progress as I follow Bro Code's "[HTML & CSS Full Course for free üåé](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=_2w9kbhNrYdMdfwx)" course on YouTube. 

   I am still debating whether or not I should make this public as this might definitely have silly code and grammatical errors along with my use of personal images / videos for practice 


















## What I've Learned So Far:

- Week 1: 
    - HTML Basics: I started with the very basics: the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. I learned how to create headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and how to add line breaks (`<br>`). I even created my first simple webpage.
    - [Lists `<li>`](https://github.com/127jackie/Website/blob/main/week%201/Lists/LISTS.md#lists-li)
    - [Tables `<table>`](https://github.com/127jackie/Website/blob/main/week%201/Tables/TABLES.md)
    - [Buttuns `<button>`]()




   

















  ## Tools & Resources
- Text Editor: 
    - **VS Code**
        - currently learning how to use and navigate - current unix user
- Learning Platforms: 
    - **BROüëèCODEüëè** on YouTube
        - as previouly stated, I am following his "[HTML & CSS Full Course for free üåé](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=_2w9kbhNrYdMdfwx)" video on YouTube. 
        - I cannot stress to poeple enough why he's my go-to when it comes to trying to grasp a new concepts. I stumbbled across this videos during my first coding course in college. He is the absolute GOAT to explaining topics in the simplest terms. His videos are straight forwards and super easy to follow. 






# What‚Äôs Next?
I‚Äôm constantly learning and improving. My next goals include:
- Diving into **JavaScript** to make my websites interactive.
- Building a portfolio site to showcase everything I‚Äôve learned.
- Collaborating with others to work on real-world projects.
