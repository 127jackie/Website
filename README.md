## Welcome :D
  > Hello! This page is created for my own pleasure and to keep track of my progress. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science major at the University of Georgia. I recently transfered to this university just the previous semester ago in Spring '24. Upon taking my first software development course here in Fall '24, ~~(after not being able to take any cs classes due to regrestion be full by the time I transferred T_T)~~ I've realized that my peers here are much more experienced and ahead compared to my skills. They've inspired me to start learning lanuages and begin creating projects on my own to further my skills. 

  > Additionally,  I  this is great practice for using Git, Github, and VS Code
  
  ## My Journey into the World of Web Development!
   In this page, I will be documenting my progress as I self teach myself HTML and CSS by following Bro Code's "[HTML & CSS Full Course for free ðŸŒŽ](https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=_2w9kbhNrYdMdfwx)" course on YouTube.
