# Headers & Footers
- both header and footers are semantic tags (elements with meaning)
- they describe meaning to both the web browser and the developer 
- they help organize content and css propertites can be easily applied to anything within the containers
- headers are used for introductory content on the top of the page (ex title, subtitle, logo, navigation bar, etc)
- footers act as a container hold concluding content at bottom of the page

- **Header** uses `<header> </header>` tags
- **Footer** uses `<footer> </footer>` tages
- suggested to put Main tags (`<main> </main>`) in between the footer and header tags for organization
